# Welcome to the new site!

Welcome to the new site! This is the first post on the new site, and I'm very excited to be able to share it with you. I've been working on this site for a while now, and I'm very happy with how it turned out. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

The new site is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). I'm using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

I'm using [tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) as a boilerplate for the site. I've made a few changes to the boilerplate, and I'm planning on making more changes in the future.

This site is still a work in progress, but hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

## What's next?

I'm planning to constantly adding more blog posts to the site.

I'm also planning to tailor [about](/about) according to latest resume.

I'm also planning to add my recent projects to [projects](/projects).

So, that's it for now. I hope you enjoyed this post. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/denshanif).

Thanks for reading!
